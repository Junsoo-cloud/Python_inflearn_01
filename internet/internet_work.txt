- How does Internet works?

- Data send way
1. satelite -> latency
2. optical fiber cables (from Data Center) -> all around the world (divided 6 bits )

* Send

- IP Address(uniquly identify)

- Domain Name (ex. youtube.com) -> hard to noice all IP Address

- DNS server -> 1. Enter Domain name -> request to the DNS Server -> Getting IP Address -> request to Data Center (from optical fiber cables)

- Protocol -> TCP / IP / https / http / RTP (control)
